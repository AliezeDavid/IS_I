# Exercise 1: Animal and Cat â€“ Java Inheritance

## Overview

This exercise demonstrates **inheritance and method overriding** in Java using a basic `Animal` and `Cat` class structure.

## Tasks Covered

- Create a superclass `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`.
- Create a subclass `Cat` that overrides the `makeSound()` method.
- Implement a `Main` class to call `makeSound()` from both classes.

### Additional Hands-On Tasks

- Add a method `scratch()` in the `Cat` class.
- Add an attribute `habitat` in `Animal` and set specific values in subclasses.
- Add a `lifespan` attribute in `Animal`, overridden by subclasses.

## Concepts Practiced

- Method Overriding
- Subclass Extensions
- Attribute Inheritance
- Encapsulation and Object Behavior

## Notes

This exercise provides a simple way to explore how child classes can enhance or override the behavior of parent classes while maintaining a clean and modular design.
